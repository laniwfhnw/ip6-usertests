User tests IP6 - Kolibri The Web UI Toolkit

First things first: Thanks for doing this user test for our project! With your feedback we will be able to improve this 
library further.

## Procedure of the user test
1. Clone this repository (use the main branch)
2. Serve the file [index.html](./index.html) using a dev server and open it in your favourite browser. 
   It is an almost empty HTML page. 
3. Open the browser console, as all results of this test will be shown there.
4. Open the file [userTest.js](./userTest.js) in an editor of your choice.
5. Solve the exercises based on two different aspects of this IP6. All exercises are marked with TODO. Everything you
   need to know is inside of this file.
6. Please fill in the [questionnaire](https://forms.gle/J1S6CnD333fkoCRT7).

_Note:_ If you are having troubles solving the exercises (or want to check if you got everything right), have a look at 
        the branch [feature/solution](https://github.com/wildwyss/ip6-usertests/tree/feature/solution), which contains 
        the solutions for this user test!
